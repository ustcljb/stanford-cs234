## 1. What is the difference between off-policy and on-policy learning?
- In **on-policy** learning the 𝑄(𝑠,𝑎) function is learned from actions, we took using our current policy 𝜋.
- In **off-policy** learning the 𝑄(𝑠,𝑎) function is learned from different actions (for example, random actions). We even don't need a policy at all!
